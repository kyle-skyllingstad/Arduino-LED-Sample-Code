# Arduino-LED-Sample-Code

# Overview
This demo program, written in Arduino (C), interacts with LED displays on a given interface. It allows certain colors to flash when respective buttons are pressed, and it utilizes live time logging and state functions to carry out the desired lighting functions.

# How to Use
This single program code, sketch_oct1c, needs the cull interface and circuitry in order for propper running, so unfortunately it cannot be run on its own. However, one can look through the example code and comments section near the top to develop a better understanding of the processes carried out in this code. For more information, feel free to reach out to me independently.
